Where to go? How? What now?)\n- Expand Porter to 7 forces (add Partnerships/Ecosystems, AI/Innovation)\n- Universal \"insufficient data\" handling (not just TAM/SAM/SOM)\n- Add review cadence specifications (quarterly/semi-annual/annual)\n\nPriority 2 (3 days):\n- Growth Hacking Loops framework (LEAP, SCALE models)\n- Multi-Criteria Decision Matrix (AHP + TOPSIS for M&A decisions)\n- Prompt engineering templates in output (RACE, TRACE, SCAN, etc.)\n- Framework integration maps (show how insights flow)\n\nPriority 3 (1 week):\n- Dynamic SWOT with confidence levels per insight\n- Probabilistic scenario planning with Monte Carlo\n- Real-world Brazilian case study references\n\nGap Analysis:\n- Missing: Question structure, prompt transparency, 2 frameworks, integration maps\n- Missing: Review governance, systematic data honesty, confidence levels\n- Strength: Already have 12 solid frameworks, cost-optimized pipeline\n\nExpected Outcomes:\n- Match PDF quality while remaining cost-effective ($18-25 vs $15-20)\n- Enable client to understand and replicate methodology\n- Transform one-time analysis into living strategy tool\n- Competitive advantage: Dynamic analysis vs static PDF templates\n\nTimeline: 2 weeks to full implementation\nROI: Can charge 2-3x for \"premium analysis tier\"\n\nðŸš€ Generated with Claude Code\nEOF\n)\")"
