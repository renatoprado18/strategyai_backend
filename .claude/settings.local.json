Where to go? How? What now?)\n- Expand Porter to 7 forces (add Partnerships/Ecosystems, AI/Innovation)\n- Universal \"insufficient data\" handling (not just TAM/SAM/SOM)\n- Add review cadence specifications (quarterly/semi-annual/annual)\n\nPriority 2 (3 days):\n- Growth Hacking Loops framework (LEAP, SCALE models)\n- Multi-Criteria Decision Matrix (AHP + TOPSIS for M&A decisions)\n- Prompt engineering templates in output (RACE, TRACE, SCAN, etc.)\n- Framework integration maps (show how insights flow)\n\nPriority 3 (1 week):\n- Dynamic SWOT with confidence levels per insight\n- Probabilistic scenario planning with Monte Carlo\n- Real-world Brazilian case study references\n\nGap Analysis:\n- Missing: Question structure, prompt transparency, 2 frameworks, integration maps\n- Missing: Review governance, systematic data honesty, confidence levels\n- Strength: Already have 12 solid frameworks, cost-optimized pipeline\n\nExpected Outcomes:\n- Match PDF quality while remaining cost-effective ($18-25 vs $15-20)\n- Enable client to understand and replicate methodology\n- Transform one-time analysis into living strategy tool\n- Competitive advantage: Dynamic analysis vs static PDF templates\n\nTimeline: 2 weeks to full implementation\nROI: Can charge 2-3x for \"premium analysis tier\"\n\n🚀 Generated with Claude Code\nEOF\n)\")",

      "Bash(git commit -m \"$(cat <<''EOF''\nfeat: Add stage-level caching for all 6 analysis stages\n\nImplemented comprehensive Supabase-backed caching for each pipeline stage\nto enable selective regeneration without re-running entire analysis.\n\nKey Features:\n- Cache wrapper: run_stage_with_cache() for all 6 stages\n- Deterministic cache keys based on input hashes (SHA-256)\n- 7-day TTL with automatic cleanup\n- Zero-token usage_stats for cache hits\n- Cost tracking per stage (saves $0.002-$0.15 per hit)\n\nCache Hit Benefits:\n- Stage 1 (Extraction): Save $0.002 + 5s\n- Stage 2 (Gap Analysis): Save $0.005 + 10s\n- Stage 3 (Strategy): Save $0.15 + 30s ⭐ BIGGEST SAVINGS\n- Stage 4 (Competitive): Save $0.05 + 15s\n- Stage 5 (Risk Scoring): Save $0.04 + 12s\n- Stage 6 (Polish): Save $0.01 + 8s\n\nUse Cases:\n1. Regenerate failed stages without re-running successful ones\n2. Iterative prompt engineering (keep upstream stages cached)\n3. A/B testing models/prompts for specific stages\n4. Debugging with reproducible results\n\nImplementation:\n- Input hashing per stage (company, industry, data hashes, params)\n- Supabase storage with in-memory LRU cache\n- Non-blocking cache writes\n- Fallback to fresh execution on cache errors\n\nTechnical Details:\n- Stage 1 input: company, industry, website, challenge, apify/perplexity hashes\n- Stage 2 input: company, industry, extracted_data hash\n- Stage 3 input: company, industry, challenge, extracted_data, sections, tier\n- Stage 4 input: company, industry, extracted_data, strategic_analysis hashes\n- Stage 5 input: company, strategic_analysis hash\n- Stage 6 input: company, strategic_analysis hash\n\nFiles Modified:\n- app/services/analysis/multistage.py: Added cache wrapper + integration\n- CACHE_IMPLEMENTATION.md: Comprehensive documentation\n\nNext Steps:\n- Monitor cache hit rates in production\n- Tune TTL based on data staleness patterns\n- Consider cache warming for high-traffic companies\n\n🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>\nEOF\n)\")"
