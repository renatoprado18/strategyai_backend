-- SYSTEM VERIFICATION QUERIES
-- Run these in Supabase SQL Editor to verify everything works
-- ============================================

-- ============================================
-- STEP 1: Check if tables exist
-- ============================================

SELECT table_name
FROM information_schema.tables
WHERE table_schema = 'public'
AND table_name IN ('submissions', 'admin_users')
ORDER BY table_name;

-- Expected result: 2 rows showing both tables exist
-- If 0 rows: Run migrations first!


-- ============================================
-- STEP 2: Check if any submissions exist
-- ============================================

SELECT
    id,
    name,
    email,
    company,
    website,
    industry,
    challenge,
    status,
    created_at,
    updated_at
FROM submissions
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Expected after form submission: At least 1 row
-- If 0 rows: Backend not connected to Supabase yet


-- ============================================
-- STEP 3: Check submission status breakdown
-- ============================================

SELECT
    status,
    COUNT(*) as count,
    ROUND(COUNT(*) * 100.0 / SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER(), 1) as percentage
FROM submissions
GROUP BY status
ORDER BY count DESC;

-- Expected results:
-- pending: 0-1 (only if currently processing)
-- completed: Most submissions
-- failed: Few or none (< 10%)


-- ============================================
-- STEP 4: Check if reports are being generated
-- ============================================

SELECT
    id,
    company,
    status,
    CASE
        WHEN report_json IS NOT NULL THEN 'Yes (' || LENGTH(report_json) || ' bytes)'

-- Expected for completed submissions:
-- status='completed'
-- has_report='Yes (5000-20000 bytes)'
-- report_size_bytes > 0
-- processing_time_minutes: 1-3 minutes


-- ============================================
-- STEP 5: View latest submission details
-- ============================================

-- This shows the most recent submission with human-readable timing


-- ============================================
-- STEP 6: View a completed report (JSON preview)
-- ============================================

SELECT
    id,
    company,
    status,
    LEFT(report_json, 500) as report_preview  -- First 500 characters
FROM submissions
WHERE status = 'completed'
AND report_json IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 1;

-- Expected: JSON structure with Portuguese text


-- ============================================
-- STEP 7: View full report for specific submission
-- ============================================

-- Replace XXX with actual submission ID
/*
SELECT
    id,
    company,
    report_json
FROM submissions
WHERE id = XXX;
*/

-- Click on the report_json cell to view formatted JSON


-- ============================================
-- STEP 8: Check for failed submissions
-- ============================================

SELECT
    id,
    company,
    status,
    error_message,
    created_at,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (NOW() - created_at)) / 60 as minutes_ago
FROM submissions
WHERE status = 'failed'
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Expected: Few or no rows
-- If many failed: Check error_message for clues


-- ============================================
-- STEP 9: Check for stuck submissions (pending > 5 min)
-- ============================================

SELECT
    id,
    company,
    status,
    created_at,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (NOW() - created_at)) / 60 as stuck_for_minutes
FROM submissions
WHERE status = 'pending'
AND created_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '5 minutes'

ORDER BY granted_at DESC;

-- Expected: At least 1 row (you or your dad)
-- If 0 rows: Need to grant admin access


-- ============================================
-- STEP 12: Check if specific user is admin
-- ============================================

-- Replace with actual user UUID from auth.users
/*
SELECT is_admin('YOUR-USER-UUID-HERE');
*/

-- Expected: true (if admin access granted)
-- If false: Run grant_admin_access() function


-- ============================================
-- STEP 13: Most recent submission with full details
