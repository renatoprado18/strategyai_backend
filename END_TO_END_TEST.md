Complete testing checklist to verify the entire Strategy AI system works correctly.

---

## üìã Testing Timeline: 30 Minutes

1. **Environment Setup** (10 min) - Fix Railway variables and redeploy
2. **Public Submission Test** (5 min) - Submit form and verify database
3. **AI Report Generation** (10 min) - Wait for and verify AI processing
4. **Admin Dashboard Test** (5 min) - Login and view reports

---

## ‚úÖ Pre-Test Checklist

Before starting tests, verify:

- [ ] Ran both Supabase migrations (`submissions` + `admin_users` tables exist)
- [ ] Deleted `DATABASE_URL` from Railway env vars
- [ ] Added `UPSTASH_REDIS_URL` to Railway env vars
- [ ] Added `UPSTASH_REDIS_TOKEN` to Railway env vars
- [ ] Railway redeployed successfully
- [ ] Railway logs show: `[STARTUP] Starting Strategy AI Backend...`

**If any unchecked ‚Üí Go to FIX_RAILWAY_NOW.md first**

## üß™ Test 1: Public Form Submission (5 min)

### Test 1.1: Submit Form

1. Open browser
2. Go to: `https://strategyai-landing.vercel.app`
3. Fill out form:
   ```
   Nome: Jo√£o Silva
   Email: joao.silva@example.com
   Empresa: TechStart Brasil
   Website: https://techstart.example.com
   Setor: Technology
   Desafio: Precisamos aumentar nossa base de clientes e melhorar o posicionamento de marca no mercado brasileiro
   ```
4. Click "Enviar" button

**Expected Result:**
- ‚úÖ Redirects to "Obrigado" (Thank You) page
- ‚úÖ No error messages
- ‚úÖ Page loads within 1-2 seconds

**If fails:**
- Check browser console for errors (F12 ‚Üí Console tab)
- Verify Vercel env var `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` is correct
- Check CORS settings in Railway

### Test 1.2: Verify in Railway Logs (Immediate)

1. Go to Railway ‚Üí `web` service ‚Üí **Deployments**
2. Click latest deployment
3. Look for log messages (should appear within 5 seconds):

**Expected Logs:**
```
[OK] New submission created: ID=1, Company=TechStart Brasil
[PROCESSING] Processing analysis for submission 1...
[APIFY] Gathering enrichment data for TechStart Brasil...
```

‚úÖ **If you see these ‚Üí Submission successful!**

‚ùå **If you see errors:**
- Screenshot error message
- Check error indicates (missing API keys, connection issues, etc.)

‚ùå **If you see nothing:**
- Backend might not be running
- Check Railway deployment status
- Verify env vars are correct

### Test 1.3: Verify in Supabase (Immediate)

1. Go to Supabase SQL Editor
2. Run:

```sql
SELECT
    id,
    name,
    email,
    company,
    status,
    created_at,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (NOW() - created_at)) / 60 as minutes_ago
FROM submissions
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

**Expected Result:**
```
id | name        | email                  | company         | status  | created_at          | minutes_ago
---|-------------|------------------------|-----------------|---------|---------------------|------------
 1 | Jo√£o Silva  | joao.silva@example.com | TechStart Brasil| pending | 2025-01-26 10:30:00 | 0.2
```

‚úÖ **If you see this ‚Üí Database write successful!**

‚ùå **If 0 rows:**
- Backend not connected to Supabase
- Check Supabase env vars in Railway
- Check Railway logs for connection errors

---

## ü§ñ Test 2: AI Report Generation (10 min)

### Test 2.1: Monitor Background Processing

**Watch Railway logs for these stages:**

**Stage 1: Apify Data Collection (30-60 seconds)**
```
[APIFY] Gathering enrichment data for TechStart Brasil...
[APIFY] Data gathering completed for submission 1
```

**Stage 2: AI Generation (10-30 seconds)**
```
[AI] Generating strategic analysis for submission 1...
```

**Stage 3: Completion (immediate)**
```
[OK] Analysis completed for submission 1
```

**Total expected time: 60-90 seconds**

‚úÖ **If you see all stages ‚Üí AI processing working!**

‚ö†Ô∏è **If you see warnings:**
```
[WARNING] Apify enrichment failed: <error>. Continuing with basic analysis...
```
This is OK - AI will still generate report, just without Apify data enrichment

‚ùå **If you see errors:**
```
[ERROR] Analysis failed for submission 1: <error message>
```
- Check error message for clues
- Common issues: Invalid API keys (Apify, OpenRouter)

### Test 2.2: Verify Report in Database (After 2 minutes)

Run in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
SELECT
    id,
    company,
    status,
    LENGTH(report_json) as report_size_bytes,
    error_message,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (updated_at - created_at)) / 60 as processing_time_minutes
FROM submissions
WHERE company = 'TechStart Brasil'
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

**Expected Result:**
```
id | company          | status    | report_size_bytes | error_message | processing_time_minutes
---|------------------|-----------|-------------------|---------------|------------------------
 1 | TechStart Brasil | completed | 12458             | null          | 1.5
```

‚úÖ **Success Criteria:**
- `status` = 'completed'
- `report_size_bytes` > 5000 (typically 5KB-20KB)
- `error_message` = null
- `processing_time_minutes` < 3 minutes

‚ùå **If failed:**
- `status` = 'failed' ‚Üí Check `error_message`
- `status` = 'pending' after 5 minutes ‚Üí Background task crashed
- `report_size_bytes` = 0 ‚Üí Report not generated

### Test 2.3: Preview Report Content

Run in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
SELECT
    id,
    company,
    LEFT(report_json, 200) as report_preview
FROM submissions
WHERE company = 'TechStart Brasil'
AND status = 'completed'
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

**Expected: JSON starting with Portuguese text like:**
```json
{"executive_summary": "A TechStart Brasil enfrenta desafios t√≠picos...
```

‚úÖ **If you see Portuguese JSON ‚Üí AI generated correctly!**

    COUNT(*)::text as value,
    CASE WHEN COUNT(*) > 0 THEN '‚úÖ' ELSE '‚ùå' END as status
FROM submissions

UNION ALL

SELECT
    'Completed',
    COUNT(*)::text,
    CASE WHEN COUNT(*) > 0 THEN '‚úÖ' ELSE '‚ö†Ô∏è' END
FROM submissions
WHERE status = 'completed'

UNION ALL

SELECT
    'Failed',
    COUNT(*)::text,
    CASE WHEN COUNT(*) = 0 THEN '‚úÖ' ELSE '‚ö†Ô∏è' END
