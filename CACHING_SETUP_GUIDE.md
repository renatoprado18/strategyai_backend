# 🚀 Enhanced Caching System - Setup & Usage Guide

## Overview

The enhanced caching system dramatically reduces API costs by caching expensive operations. With aggressive caching, you can save **$15-25 per analysis** on cache hits!

### Cost Savings Potential

| Cache Type | Cost Saved Per Hit | TTL | Use Case |
|-----------|-------------------|-----|----------|
| **Analysis Cache** | **$15-25** ⭐ | 30 days | Complete AI analysis results |
| **Stage Cache** | $0.10-3 | 7 days | Individual pipeline stages |
| **Dashboard Stats** | N/A (speed) | 5 minutes | Admin dashboard queries |
| **Institutional Memory** | $4-6 | 7 days | Apify & Perplexity data |

**Projected Savings:** If 30% of analyses are cache hits, save ~$1,500/month on 1,000 analyses!

## 📋 Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Create Cache Tables in Supabase

1. Open your Supabase project: https://supabase.com
2. Go to **SQL Editor**
3. Copy the entire contents of `cache_tables_schema.sql`
4. Paste and run the SQL script

This will create 4 new tables:
- `analysis_cache` - Stores complete analysis results (THE most important!)
- `stage_cache` - Stores individual pipeline stage results
- `pdf_cache` - Stores PDF generation metadata
- `stats_cache` - Stores dashboard statistics

### Step 2: Verify Tables Created

Run this query in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
SELECT tablename FROM pg_tables
WHERE tablename IN ('analysis_cache', 'stage_cache', 'pdf_cache', 'stats_cache')
ORDER BY tablename;
```

You should see all 4 tables listed.

### Step 3: Deploy Updated Code

The caching system is already integrated into:
- ✅ `main.py` - Analysis result caching + dashboard stats caching
- ✅ `enhanced_cache.py` - Core caching module (NEW file)
- ✅ `institutional_memory.py` - Existing Apify/Perplexity caching (unchanged)

No additional configuration needed - it works automatically!

## 🎯 How It Works

### 1. Analysis Result Caching (Most Important!)

**When someone requests an analysis:**

```
User submits form → Check cache first
  ├─ Cache HIT? → Return instantly (saves $15-25!) ⚡
  └─ Cache MISS? → Generate analysis → Cache result → Return
```

**Cache Key:** `company + industry + challenge + website`

**Example:**
- First request for "ACME Corp" in "Technology" with challenge "Expand market" → $20 cost, 3-5 min
- Second identical request → $0 cost, < 1 second! ✨

### 2. Dashboard Stats Caching

**When admin views dashboard:**

```
Admin opens dashboard → Check cache (5 min TTL)
  ├─ Cache HIT? → Return instantly
  └─ Cache MISS? → Query database → Cache for 5 min → Return
```

Dramatically speeds up dashboard for high-traffic admin usage.

### 3. Institutional Memory Caching

**Already implemented - caches:**
- ✅ Apify data (website scraping, competitors, trends) - 7 days
- ✅ Perplexity research queries - 14 days
- ✅ Company profiles - 30 days
- ✅ Industry insights - 3 days

## 🎮 Cache Management

### Viewing Cache in Supabase

1. Go to **Table Editor** in Supabase
2. Select `analysis_cache` table
3. Sort by `hit_count` DESC to see most popular analyses
4. Sort by `last_accessed_at` DESC to see recently used caches

### Manual Cache Operations

#### Query Cache Hit Rate
```sql
SELECT * FROM get_cache_hit_rate();
```

#### View Top Cached Analyses
```sql
SELECT
  company,
  industry,
  hit_count,
  cost_saved,
  (cost_saved * hit_count) as total_saved,
  last_accessed_at
FROM analysis_cache
ORDER BY (cost_saved * hit_count) DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

#### Clear Old Cache Manually
```sql
SELECT * FROM clear_old_cache();
```

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Cache TTLs (Time To Live)

Configured in `enhanced_cache.py`:

```python
TTL_ANALYSIS = 24 * 30  # 30 days
TTL_STAGE = 24 * 7      # 7 days
TTL_PDF = 24 * 90       # 90 days
TTL_STATS = 1/12        # 5 minutes
TTL_PERPLEXITY = 24 * 14  # 14 days
```

**Adjust based on your needs:**
- ⬆️ Increase TTL = More cache hits, less current data
- ⬇️ Decrease TTL = Fewer cache hits, more current data

### Cache Invalidation

**When to invalidate cache:**

1. **Company data changed significantly** - Clear that company's analysis cache
2. **Industry trends shifted** - Clear industry-related caches
3. **AI model updated** - Clear all analysis caches (rare)

**Manual Invalidation:**
```sql
-- Clear specific company
DELETE FROM analysis_cache WHERE company = 'ACME Corp';

-- Clear specific industry
DELETE FROM analysis_cache WHERE industry = 'Technology';

-- Clear all (nuclear option)
TRUNCATE TABLE analysis_cache RESTART IDENTITY CASCADE;
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Cache Not Working?

**1. Check if tables exist:**
```sql
SELECT tablename FROM pg_tables
WHERE tablename LIKE '%cache%';
```

**2. Check if caching code is running:**
Look for these log messages:
- `[CACHE] 🔍 Checking analysis cache...`
- `[CACHE] 🎯 Cache HIT!` (good!)
- `[CACHE] ❌ Cache miss` (normal for first request)
- `[CACHE] ✅ Analysis cached`

**3. Check Supabase RLS policies:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM pg_policies
WHERE tablename IN ('analysis_cache', 'stage_cache');
```

Should show policies allowing service_role to read/write.

### Low Cache Hit Rate?

**Possible causes:**

1. **Challenges are too unique** - Each different challenge creates new cache entry
   - *Solution:* Consider normalizing challenges or using fuzzy matching

2. **Cache TTL too short** - Cache expires before being reused
   - *Solution:* Increase TTL in `enhanced_cache.py`

3. **Not enough repeated requests** - Need volume for cache benefits
   - *Solution:* Marketing! More traffic = better cache performance

4. **Cache clearing too frequently** - Someone running `clear_expired_cache()` too often
   - *Solution:* Run daily, not hourly

## 📈 Performance Optimization Tips

### 1. Pre-Populate Common Analyses

For your top industries/companies, generate analyses during off-peak hours:

```python
# Run this script nightly
common_companies = [
    {"company": "Common Inc", "industry": "Technology", "challenge": "Expand market"},
    {"company": "Popular Co", "industry": "Healthcare", "challenge": "Increase revenue"},
    # ... more
]

for item in common_companies:
    # This will cache the analysis
    await process_analysis_task(submission_id)
```

### 2. Monitor Cache Patterns

Query most-requested companies weekly:

```sql
SELECT company, industry, COUNT(*) as requests
FROM submissions
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
GROUP BY company, industry
ORDER BY requests DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

Pre-cache these popular combinations.

### 3. Adjust TTLs Based on Industry

Some industries change faster than others:

- **Fast-changing:** Crypto, Tech → 7 days TTL
- **Stable:** Manufacturing, Healthcare → 90 days TTL

Implement industry-specific TTLs if needed.

### 4. Use In-Memory Cache Wisely

The `_analysis_cache` dict provides sub-millisecond access but:
- ⚠️ Resets on server restart
- ⚠️ Limited by RAM (keep < 1000 entries)

For production, consider Redis for distributed in-memory caching.

---

## 🚀 Advanced: Redis Integration (Optional)

For high-traffic production systems, add Redis:

### Install Redis Client
```bash
pip install redis aioredis
```

### Update enhanced_cache.py
```python
import aioredis

redis = await aioredis.create_redis_pool('redis://localhost')

async def get_cached_analysis(company, industry, challenge, website):
    # Check Redis first (fastest)
    cache_key = generate_analysis_cache_key(company, industry, challenge, website)
    cached = await redis.get(cache_key)

    if cached:
        return json.loads(cached)

    # Fall back to Supabase...
```

**Benefits:**
- ⚡ Sub-millisecond cache access
- 🌐 Distributed caching across multiple servers
- 💾 Persist across restarts (if configured)

## 📞 Support

### Common Issues

**Issue:** "Table does not exist"
- **Fix:** Run `cache_tables_schema.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor

**Issue:** "Permission denied for table"
- **Fix:** Check RLS policies - service_role should have full access

**Issue:** Cache not hitting
- **Fix:** Check cache key generation - must be identical for same inputs

### Debug Mode

Enable verbose cache logging:

```python
# In enhanced_cache.py
logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
```

This will show every cache check, hit, and miss.
